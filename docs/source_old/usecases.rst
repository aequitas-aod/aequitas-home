Use Cases
#########

Aequitas has incorporated six use cases (covering three different domains) that serve two main purposes. First, at the outset of the project, the use cases provided context and concrete requirements for the Aequitas framework. Secondly, more towards the later stages of the projects, the use case owners will use the data and context of their use case to validate the functionality of the Aequitas framework as a test of its features.

*Below we detail the use cases and the experimentation done in the context of the validation. Please note that the bullets below are hyperlinks to a (new) page dedicated to that particular use case.*
