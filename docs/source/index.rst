Welcome to the AEQUITAS Framework for AI Fairness
=================================================

The **AEQUITAS** Framework is an innovative approach designed to ensure fairness
and trust in AI-based decision support systems. It proposes a controlled
experimentation environment for developers and users to:

* **Assess** bias in AI systems by identifying potential sources in data,
  algorithms, and result interpretation.
* Offer effective methods and engineering guidelines to **repair, and mitigate**
  bias when possible.
* Provide **fairness-by-design** guidelines, methodologies, and software
  engineering techniques to create new, bias-free systems.

The framework includes an experimentation environment that generates synthetic
datasets with various features impacting fairness, allowing laboratory tests.

Real-world use cases in healthcare, human resources, and social challenges are
also provided and discussed along with different solutions and comparison.
