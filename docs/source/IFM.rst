Information Flow Modelling (IFM)
================================

The Information Flow Model (IFM) is a structured methodology for analysing socio-
technical decision systems by modelling how information is created, transformed,
filtered, and used across both human and technical components. IFM represents
decision-making processes as a directed graph of information sites and channels, which
makes it possible to trace how outcomes are formed, where biases may be introduced,
and how these propagate to affect stakeholders. Originally developed as part of
AEQUITAS for AI Act compliance and fairness assessment, IFM provides a unified lens
through which technical operations (datasets, models, algorithms) and social processes
(human evaluations, organisational routines) can be jointly examined. In this report, we
apply IFM to the Akkodis use case to complement the FDCGM methodology: while
FDCGM assessed the fairness of the dataset itself, IFM focuses on how decisions and
potential biases emerge in the end-to-end socio-technical recruitment chain. Together,
the two methodologies validate different AEQUITAS blocks and illustrate how fairness-
by-design requires both data-level and process-level perspectives.
