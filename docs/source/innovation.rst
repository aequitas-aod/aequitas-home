Innovative Bias Detection and Mitigation Techniques
=================================================

In our continuous effort to enhance fairness and accuracy in AI systems, the AEQUITAS project has pioneered a suite of innovative techniques designed to detected and mitigate bias. These advanced techniques are embedded directly within our experimentation tool, providing users with powerful, accessible means to conduct experiments and refine processes. The list below details the cutting-edge techniques we have developed, each tailored to address specific challenges in bias detection and correction.

Bias Detection & Awareness
------

This section outlines our key contributions to bias detection and awareness, featuring cutting-edge research and methodologies that address the complex challenges posed by socio-technical decision-making environments. New tools for detection have been proposed as well as new metrics for bias evaluation. Each entry below details a significant advancement in the field, designed to refine how we assess, understand, and correct biases in AI applications.

* `Impact based fairness framework for socio-technical decision making <https://ceur-ws.org/Vol-3523/paper12.pdf>`_: This paper introduces the AEQUITAS Socio-Technical System Assessment tool, which evaluates the broader impact of AI-driven decisions on society. The tool aims to ensure that automated decisions contribute positively to social equity and cohesion.

* Generalization of existing SoA metrics
  * `Generalized Disparate Impact for Configurable Fairness Solutions in ML <https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/giuliani23a/giuliani23a.pdf>`_: Introduce a new metric that enhances traditional metrics to better handle data attributes that vary continuously, providing a more detailed and accurate analysis.
  * `AI-fairness and equality of opportunity: a case study on educational achievement <https://ceur-ws.org/Vol-3808/paper17.pdf>`_: Introduce a new metric that Incorporates considerations of the social and legal context in the bias assessment, adapting detection techniques to be sensitive to changing regulations and cultural expectations.
